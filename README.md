# Smile-Selfie-Capture-Project-OPEN-CV
Overview

This project uses OpenCV and Haarcascade classifiers to detect faces and smiles, automatically capturing a selfie when a smile is detected. It is implemented in Python.

Features

Real-time face detection

Smile detection triggering selfie capture

Uses Haarcascade classifiers for accurate detection

Captures and saves selfies automatically
